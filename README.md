# About me

Hi! I'm Luca, a software engineer and theatre technician. In 2021 in graduated from Lancaster University's MSci Computer Science degree scheme, having earned myself a First Class Honours degree in Computer Science (with Industrial Experience). I was taught in *Visual Basic .NET* with Visual Studio in my A-levels, from which I was easily able to pick up _C#_ before taking my study further in University. Lancaster re-introduced programming with _C_ before delving much deeper with _Java_. _Python_ featured a few times in various modules, as did _Assembly_ language (MIPS and PIC).

During my time at university, I was both of one of the first undergraduate Teaching Assistants in our department and Education Officer for the Computer Science Society. In these roles I both mentored students one-to-one in labs, giving guidance where needed, and presented small workshops and sessions.

After graduating from Lancaster, I began work near Cambridge as a Graduate Software Engineer, working primarily with _C# .NET_ in development and maintenance of an Android/iOS mobile app for management of performance vehicle driving telemetry and audio/visual recordings. After struggling to settle in Cambridge, largely due to on-going effects from the covid-19 pandemic, I decided to take my chance to attempt to turn my hobby into a career as a theatre and events technician.

Though I had about 8/9 years of experience in school and amateur theatre under all sorts of backstage guises at this point, I began professionally as a venue technician at Edinburgh Fringe, before going freelance for a while, then eventually taking a fulltime role as Lighting & Sound Technician at the Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham, which is where you can find me today. I've been at the Everyman since April 2023, and have learnt huge amounts for weekly get-ins, get-outs, and show running for everything from one-night music acts to number one touring musicals that barely fit into our theatre. I document the shows that come through over on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/technicallyluca/).
