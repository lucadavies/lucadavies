# About me

Hi! I'm Luca, a recent graduate from Lancaster University's MSci Computer Science degree scheme, having earnt myself a First Class Honours degree in Computer Science (with Industiral Experience). I was taught in *Visual Basic .NET* with Visual Studio in my A-levels, from which I was easily able to pick up _C#_ before taking my study further in University. Lancaster re-introduced programming with _C_ before delving much deeper with _Java_. _Python_ featured a few times in various modules, as did _Assembly_ language (MIPS and PIC).

During my time at university, I was both of one of the first undergraduate Teaching Assistants in our department and Education Officer for the Computer Science Society and both mentored students one-to-one in labs, giving guidance where needed, and presented small workshops and sessions.

I currently work near Cambridge as a Graduate Software Engineer, working primarly with _C# .NET_ in development and maintenance of a mobile app for Android/iOS for management of performance vehicle driving telemtry and audio/visual recordings.
