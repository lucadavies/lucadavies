# About me

Hi! I'm Luca, a recent graduate from Lancaster University's MSci Computer Science degree scheme, having earnt myself a First Class Honours degree in Computer Science (with Industiral Experience). I'm currently searching for jobs to actually begin a career in the field I've studied for the last six years. In a perfect world, I'll end up with something in my areas of interest: videos games, theatre/live events, cars.

I was taught in *Visual Basic .NET* with Visual Studio in my A-levels, from which I was easily able to pick up *C#* before taking my study further in University. Lancaster re-introduced programming with *C* before delving much deeper with *Java*. *Python* featured a few times in various modules, as did *Assembly* language (MIPS and PIC).

During my time at university, I was both of one of the first undergraduate Teaching Assistants in our department and Education Officer for the Computer Science Society and both mentored students one-to-one in labs, giving guidance where needed, and presented small workshops and sessions.
