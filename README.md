# About me

Hi! I'm Luca, a recent graduate from Lancaster University's MSci Computer Science degree scheme, having earnt myself a First Class Honours degree in Computer Science (with Industiral Experience). I was taught in *Visual Basic .NET* with Visual Studio in my A-levels, from which I was easily able to pick up _C#_ before taking my study further in University. Lancaster re-introduced programming with _C_ before delving much deeper with _Java_. _Python_ featured a few times in various modules, as did _Assembly_ language (MIPS and PIC).

During my time at university, I was both of one of the first undergraduate Teaching Assistants in our department and Education Officer for the Computer Science Society. In these roles I both mentored students one-to-one in labs, giving guidance where needed, and presented small workshops and sessions.

After graduationg from Lancaster, I began work near Cambridge as a Graduate Software Engineer, working primarly with _C# .NET_ in development and maintenance of an Android/iOS mobile app for management of performance vehicle driving telemtry and audio/visual recordings. After struggling to settle in Cambridge, I decided to take my chance to attempt to turn my hobby into a career as a theatre and events technician.

Though I had about 8/9 years of experience in school and amateur theatre under all sorts of backstage guises at this point, I began professionally as a venue techinician at Edinburgh Fringe, before going freelance for a while, then eventually taking a fulltime role as Lighting & Sound Technician at the Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham, which is wher you can find me today.
